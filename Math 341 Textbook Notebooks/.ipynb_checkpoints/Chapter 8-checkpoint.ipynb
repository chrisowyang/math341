    "Imagine are traveling and have 2 flights to catch. Unfortunately, you didn’t plan well and have a 0 minute layover, that is if your first flight is late and the next flight is on time then you will miss your second flight, ruining all your travel plans. Make the unreasonable assumptions that airline delays are independent, so that if your first flight is delayed it does not have any effect on the probability that any of your latter flights are delayed. Assume also that 75% of the time flights are on-time, and if the flight is late then the probability it is exactly t minutes late is $1/t^2$ for any real $t ≥ 0$. What is the probability you do not miss your second flight?\n",
