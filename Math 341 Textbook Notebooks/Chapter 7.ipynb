    "For our example of flipping a fair coin three times from §7.1, we have $Prob(X_i = 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $Prob(X_i = 0) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and all other values have zero probability of hap- pening. Things are more interesting for ${X}$, the number of heads in three tosses of a fair coin. As each of the eight outcomes are equally likely, all we have to do is count how often $X$ equals $x$ and divide by 8. Equivalently, we just multiply by $\\frac{1}{8}$ for each outcome with $x$ heads. Thus\n",

It’s expensive to store large lists and it slows down the computer enormously. For this problem, we really don’t need to save all these values; we just want to keep track of how often we get each sum, we don’t care about the order in which we get the sums. Thus, rather than saving our results in a list we should have an array of the 11 possible outcomes (from 2 to 12) and increment, as done in the following code."
